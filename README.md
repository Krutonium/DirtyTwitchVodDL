# DirtyTwitchVodDL
Downloads twitch vods for which you have extracted the .ts path.

You need to get the URL of the vod from the path that the player uses - `https://d2nvs31859zcd8.cloudfront.net/d425962f3cfdbb8c29c5_pfckrutonium_39877408190_1601234926/chunked/`. It will download until the VOD is completely downloaded, then merge it all into one large .mp4 file.
